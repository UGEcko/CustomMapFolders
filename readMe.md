## Installation
1) Install the latest version of CMF in [releases](github.com/UGEcko/CustomMapFolders/releases/latest) and put it in your ``Plugins`` folder.
2) Run ChroMapper atleast once.


## Usage 
Using CMF is really simple. The plugin adds a new ``+`` button where you see your map folders. Clicking this will show a UI to create a new Custom Map Folder.
<br>

Provide atleast the name of the folder (What the button will show), and a valid maps folder path. You can also change the color of the text!
<br>
Now the folder will show all valid songs in the directory you provided!

If you would like to change any of these properties at any time, right click the button and it will show a slightly modified UI so you can change any of the properties of the button.

Notice: The configuration file for this plugin is located in ChroMappers LocalLow AppData folder : ``LocalLow/BinaryElement/Chromapper/CustomMapFolders.json`` in case there are any issues.
